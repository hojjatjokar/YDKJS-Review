# Chapter 1

1. ### What's code compilation?
   Code compilation is a set of steps that process the text of your code and
   turn it into a list of instructions the computer can understand. Typically,
   the whole source code is transformed at once, and those resulting
   instructions are saved as output (usually in a file) that can later be
   executed.
2. ### What's Interpretation, and how is it different from code compilation?
   Interpretation performs a similar task to the compilation, in that it
   transforms your program into machine-understandable instructions. But the
   processing model is different. Unlike a program being compiled all at once,
   with the interpretation the source code is transformed line by line; each
   line or statement is executed before immediately proceeding to processing the
   next line of the source code.
